# Infrastructure Homework

## Please document:

* Architect out a POC of BigData processing on GCP
* Do Not actually build anything, just document it
  
All documentation will be contained in a Github repo shared back to the interviewing team.  

Please:

*Do not spend more than 2 hours on this homework*

*Do not use your current employers computer to complete the homework*

*This is a POC of BigData on GCP, think development environment quality, not production which requires more than 2 hours*

If you hit the 2 hour mark and are not done, please stop working on the homework.  Come into the interview and we will discuss your progress, using it as part of the interview.  There only way to fail this homework is to not start it at all.

* Cloud Cost is the least important factor
* Uptime and low complexity of infrastructure management is most important factor
* Cloud native & best practices GCP infrastructure is preferred
* Customers of the BigData output are the sales teams who are selling the enterprises software

## Topics for discussion:

* High level overview of the BigData infrastructure you are proposing
* What other ways could this have been deployed?
