# Candidate Homework Discussion

## The premise

* The candidate is presenting their proposal for a POC of BigData on GCP
* The interviewers are assuming the role of the imaginary startup founder asking for the POC
* The goal of the discussion is to allow the candidate to show:
  * how they think about infrastructure
  * how they communicate how they think about infrastructure
  * how they can contribute to a healthy infrastructure culture

## What to look for

When the candidate is presenting their proposed solution you the interviewer are looking for certain indications on how they think.  

### An incomplete list of indicators

* Simplicity in engineering
* Cloud native services
* Following GCP best practices
* Referencing of documentation
* Clear communication

### A best practices infrastructure

The simplest, cloud native, GCP best practices solution for BigData on GCP would be:

* Using GCP native BigData services
  * BigQuery
  * Vertex AI
  * Gemeni


### Challenging the proposal

An important factor in a good engineer is willing to have their ideas challenged and will listen, accept the feedback, and then clearly answer the challenge.

Potential challenges:

* Why not just run this in our datacenter?
* Why not just wire up an Open Source Software tool like Apache Spark?
